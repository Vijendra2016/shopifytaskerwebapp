    <p>Commercial Shopify themes & apps are great for lower level merchants.  But not for big brands.  You can’t share a design with another company by using a template.  You just can’t.  You need a custom build, created around your brand.  Each and every pixel needs to be yours.  Design.  Development.  100% unique.
